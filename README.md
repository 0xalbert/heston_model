# Heston model

This is a R port of the original [work](https://github.com/jcfrei/Heston) available for Matlab.

It is an implementation of the Heston option pricing function based on the work by Christian Kahl, Peter JÃ¤ckel and Roger Lord. The standard Heston model is characterized by high numerical instability of the integral which have been reduced in this implementation.
