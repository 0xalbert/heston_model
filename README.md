# Heston model

This is a port of the original [work](https://github.com/jcfrei/Heston) available on the Matlab platform to R.

It is an implementation of the Heston option pricing function based on the work by Christian Kahl, Peter JÃ¤ckel and Roger Lord. The standard Heston model is characterized by high numerical instability of the integral which have been reduced in this implementation.
